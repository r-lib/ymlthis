ymlthis makes it easy to write YAML front matter for R Markdown and related documents. `yml_*()` functions write functions and `use_*()` functions let you write the resulting YAML to your clipboard or to `.yml` files related to your project.

## Installation

You can install ymlthis from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("ymlthis")
```

Or you can install the development version of ymlthis from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("r-lib/ymlthis")
```

## Example

`yml()` creates a basic `yml` object returns simple YAML with the author and date.

```{r example}
library(ymlthis)

yml()
```

ymlthis supports many YAML arguments, with YAML-generating functions prefixed with `yml_*()`:

```{r example-2, warning=FALSE}
yml() %>% 
  yml_author(c("Yihui Xie", "Hadley Wickham"), affiliation = "RStudio") %>% 
  yml_date(lubridate::today()) %>% 
  yml_output(
    word_document(keep_md = TRUE), 
    bookdown::html_document2()
  ) %>% 
  yml_citations(bibliography = "references.bib", csl = "aje.csl")
```

## Add-in 

ymlthis also includes an add-in that will create YAML for you and put it in a file, such as an `.Rmd` file, or on your clipboard.
